This project utilizes the k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm to classify companies into
"Tech" and "Non-Tech" categories based on the number of employees and revenue. The dataset
is generated hypothetically, and features are standardized for model training. The trained KNN
model is then employed to predict the company types on a test set. The project concludes with a
comprehensive evaluation, including accuracy, a classification report, and a confusion matrix
visualization.
